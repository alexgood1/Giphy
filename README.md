## Giphy - TV Stars
A dynamic web page that generates random gifs in the category of your choosing.
Gifs based on keywords are generated dynamically using the Giphy API and users can add a keyword to display new gifs. 

## How To Use:
A modern web browser is recommended to use this app. Bootstrap allows this app to be fully responsive and viewable on web and mobile. To display a wall of random gifs, click on one of the topics displayed as buttons at the top, or type in a custom topic in the search bar, and press the search button. This will add the topic to the buttons up top. Then click on your new button to see the results. The gifs will animate when your mouse hovers over them.
